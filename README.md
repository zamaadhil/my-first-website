# My First Website

## Project Description  
This project represents my first attempt at building a full-stack website. It combines front-end design with back-end functionality to create a seamless and efficient platform for managing and displaying data.

### Features:
- **Front-End**: Built using **HTML** and **CSS** to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- **Back-End**: Developed with **Python** to handle server-side logic and connect the front-end to the database.
- **Database Management**: Used **SQL** for efficient data storage and retrieval.
  
This project helped me enhance my skills in web development, database management, and integrating front-end with back-end systems.
